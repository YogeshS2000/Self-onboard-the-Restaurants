# Self-onboard-the-Restaurants
The goal of this system is to collect basic merchant details for restaurants that want to self-onboard to the food delivery company's platform. The system uses a RESTful API built with Node.js and a MongoDB database to store and retrieve the data. The API allows users to add new restaurants.
